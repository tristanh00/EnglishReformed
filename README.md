# English Reformed 

`English Reformed` is an ambitious project that strives to bring a comprehensive reform to English spelling. 

English, with its rich expressiveness and extensive usage, could be more accessible and learnable by addressing the complexities in its spelling rules.

Drawing inspiration from numerous attempts at spelling reform, we've studied and distilled the most practical aspects of a multitude of systems such as:

- Simple English, a simplified version of English proposed for non-native speakers or those who struggle with standard English.
- Cut Spelling, an initiative of the Simplified Spelling Society, which advocates for the removal of redundant letters and the simplification of spelling rules without altering pronunciation.
- SoundSpel, a modern reform proposal aiming to match spelling more closely with pronunciation.
- The Shaw Alphabet or Shavian, a completely new alphabet devised to simplify the phonetic orthography of the English language.
- Various reform proposals presented by the English Spelling Society over more than a century.
- Even historical proposals such as that of Benjamin Franklin, who designed a phonetic alphabet intending to uncomplicate spelling and pronunciation.

We have analyzed these systems, each with its unique strengths and rationale, to synthesize a single, streamlined approach that maintains respect for the language's history while simplifying it for learners at all levels.

Our mission is not to supplant English, but rather to offer a more logical, simplified variant that can coexist with traditional English, helping to break down barriers to literacy and global communication.
